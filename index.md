The second version of the Efficient Natural Language and Speech Processing (ENLSP-II) workshop focuses on fundamental and challenging problems to make natural language and speech processing (especially pre-trained models) more efficient in terms of <b>Data, Model, Training, and Inference</b>. The workshop program offers an interactive platform for gathering different experts and talents from academia and industry through invited talks, panel discussion, paper submissions, reviews, interactive posters, oral presentations and a mentorship program. This will be a unique opportunity to address the efficiency issues of current models, build connections, exchange ideas and brainstorm solutions, and foster future collaborations. The topics of this workshop can be of interest for people working on general machine learning, deep learning, optimization, theory and NLP & Speech applications.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Generative AI, particularly foundation models, is revolutionizing scientific discovery, simulation, and inference across the physical sciences. Traditional computational methods often become computationally intractable when modeling interactions spanning diverse scales and integrating heterogeneous data modalities. Generative AI addresses these challenges by learning latent representations that bridge these gaps and augment physics-based simulations with data-driven insights. In physics, such models can unify observational and simulated data, enabling high-resolution reconstructions of complex structures. In earth sciences, generative AI trained on extensive reanalysis datasets offers faster and more versatile capabilities than traditional numerical weather prediction, improving forecasting, climate modeling, and data assimilation. In materials science, generative approaches that leverage multimodal data sources accelerate materials discovery by efficiently navigating large compositional spaces and predicting novel compounds with tailored properties.
<br><br>
Despite these advancements, ensuring the scientific reliability of generative AI remains a formidable challenge. Scaling models to billions of parameters enhances their generative capacity, but raises fundamental questions about robustness, uncertainty quantification, and adherence to physical principles. The interplay between scale and reliability requires new strategies for integrating domain knowledge, physical constraints, and uncertainty-aware generative models. This workshop will bring together researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry to explore how generative AI can be systematically aligned with the demands of scientific discovery. Discussions will focus on methods for scaling models while preserving physical validity, multimodal coherence, and generalization across scientific regimes. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, this workshop aims to define a roadmap for building generative AI systems that are scalable, trustworthy, interpretable, and robust in advancing our understanding of the physical sciences.
